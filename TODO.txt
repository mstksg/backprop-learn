*   Reset if diverge
*   Feedback loops
*   Get rid of initial state completely nad just require initialiation to zero
    for destate
*   trace state or internal activations once unrolled? (actually maybe easy)
*   KL-divergence autencoders
*   Variational autoencoders
*   Address regularization
*   GRU lstms
*   Binary
